ARTSIDEOUT has truly been with me in every step of my university experience, and I’m so glad that I was able to be a part of it. It’s incredible to see how art can truly connect people from all ends of the globe in ways that little else can. When the COVID-19 pandemic was at its height, and multiple incidents around the world had me feeling like there was nothing good left in this world, music was what kept me going, and writing was the outlet that helped me let out my emotions. Art, in many ways, helps us endure through and through, even when we are at our lowest."

Without understating the impact this has had on us all, I have to say as Chair of Arts, Culture & Media that I have been constantly impressed by our community's capability to adapt. Sometimes I find comfort in stepping back and thinking about all that humans everywhere have endured for centuries, millennia, and how making art has been a solace for us the whole time, as a means for us to hope, to commune, to protest, to cry out, to reveal, to teach, to heal. Here in our community, ArtSideOut has been there to give our students the space for all those experiences, participating in this ancient practice. Thank you for your hard work. It matters."

I essentially conducted my daily routine in two opposing time zones that led to constant exhaustion, stress, and sometimes anxiety.
